### Thoughts

I copy the articles into ``xxx.docx`` when I study English and mark the words I don't know. Extract the words into the ``xxx.txt`` file and recite them with the "No Memorized Words App".  

**Currently this program will help me to extract the marked words**

### Use

- If you want to use it, please replace the key https://unidoc.io/unioffice/ (Use the Free version)
    ```text
    license.SetMeteredKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    ```
- Only the current marker color supports red

- No ``doc`` support
